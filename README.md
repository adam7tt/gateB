# Setup

## Requirements

- Java (JDK)

- [Magnolia CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magnolia/cli) installed ([installation documentation](https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS/Magnolia+CLI+v3))

## Install Magnolia with Magnolia CLI

In a terminal, navigate to the `magnolia` directory and run:

```
mgnl jumpstart -s
```

Choose `magnolia-community-demo-webapp` or `magnolia-dx-core-demo-webapp` as the version to download.

(Magnolia is downloaded.)

## Add the demo light modules to Magnolia

Nothing to do here!
(The Magnolia instance is pre-configured to access the existing 'light-modules' directory.)

## Start Magnolia

From within the `magnolia` start Magnolia with:

```
mgnl start
```

Once the terminal shows `Server startup in X ms`

In your browser, open Magnolia at: http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor/

## Accessing Magnolia

You can log in to Magnolia using the credentials `superuser/superuser`.
This will give you complete access to all content and configuration.

To access the apps that are mentioned in these instructions use the grid icon at the top of the page, to the right of the search bar.

## Configuring REST and DAM security

### DAM

In order for images to be displayed:
Open the Security app, open the `Roles` tab, edit the `anonymous` role, go to `Web access` tab, `Add new` with this path `/dam/*` set to GET.

# Deploy your SPA to Magnolia

Build and deploy the SPA to Magnolia to make it available for editing.

### Vue

Go to `/spa/vue-minimal` on the terminal and run `npm install`, and then `npm run deploy:mgnl`.

Once built, check that the app is deployed to `magnolia/light-modules/vue-minimal-lm/webresources/dist`.

See the `.env` files for important configurations.

> Vue example is using [vue-editor.vue](https://git.magnolia-cms.com/projects/DEMOS/repos/minimal-headless-spa-demos/browse/spa/vue-minimal/src/vue-editor.vue) to connect Vue app to Magnolia. It is a good example of creating Magnolia connector for any framework.

## Create some sample content

Either import some content, or create it manually.

### Import:

Use the 'Import' action (with nothing selected) and select the appropriate file from `/magnolia/_dev/content-to-import/`, either `website.react-minimal.yaml`, `website.angular-minimal.yaml` or `website.vue-minimal.yaml` .

### Manually:

Open the `Pages` app in Magnolia and add either

- A `React: Basic` page and name it `react-minimal`
- A `Angular: Basic` page and name it `angular-minimal`
- A `Vue: Basic` page and name it `vue-minimal`

> The page name is important as the SPA's are hardcoded to treat those names as the base of the app.

Then add components into the `Main` or `Extras` area of the page.
You can also add additional pages as children of that page.

## Running your SPA in development mode

### Vue

Build and start the headless Vue application inside `/spa/vue-minimal` by running `npm run serve`.

# Additional Information

## CORS set up

## Because you installed the `magnolia-community-demo-webapp` bundle, CORS is already configured. Read on to learn how to configure it:

By default, Magnolia does not add any [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) headers to its responses.

However, since Magnolia will be on port 8080 with the React dev server is on port 3000, CORS must be configured.

Magnolia allows you to configure any number of
[Java servlet filters](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/filters-137243.html) that can manipulate the HTTP
request/response and with a Magnolia-provided AddHeadersFilter we can set a generic "use anywhere" CORS header for the purpose of this demo.

**NOTE** As with the security config, such a wide-ranging approach to CORS may not be appropriate in production.

The AddHeadersFilter can be configured manually as [described in the documentation](https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS61/Filters#Filters-AddingHTTPheaders)
or via the [supplied Groovy script](add-cors-filter.groovy).

## Security set up

By default, the author instance of Magnolia
(see: [Instances](https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS61/Instances)) is restricted to authorised users.

For the purpose of this demo, we want to allow anonymous access to the REST endpoint describing the configured content.
(see: [Security](https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS61/Security))

The endpoint is http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor/.rest/pages.
Opening this while not logged in will produce the log in page.

### Content endpoint permissions

The app has anonymous access to Magnolia REST endpoints with no additional configuration because:

- "Web access" is allowed, because the restEndpoint files are under the `/delivery` path
- "Access contol list" access is allowed, beause the restEndponts have the `bypassWorkspaceAcls` property.

**NOTE** Allowing anonymous access may not be suitable for a production environment where you wish to keep data private.

### TemplateDefinitions

If you want to debug the editing features when running the app outside of the Magnolia page editor, you will want permissions to the templateDefinitions endpoint:

Open the Security app, open the Roles tab, edit the `rest-anonuymous` role, go to `Web access` tab, `Add new` with this path `/.rest/templateDefinition*` set to GET.
